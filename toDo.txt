minors
- implement for low.var in the geneExpressionVariability method
- improve the (gg)plot in the geneExpressionVariability method
- perhaps improve the constructors of Samples to include more information

majors
- create a sc vs bulk comparison function
- complete the identifyDoublets functions
- create pcaMethods to separate 	
- create cellCycleIdentification method
	- requires: find set of genes for the different phases
	- install.packages('VennDiagram') and play with the draw.triple.Venn method
- refactor compareGeneExpressionLevels 
	- separate the computation (should return a df) from the plotting function
	- separate the computation of correlation into a new function


HIGH PRIORITY
- implement 'method' parameter for the compareGeneExpressionLevels,
	learn a bit about pearson vs spearman
- sc vs bulk comparison
	- computes correlation between sample and bulk 
		(extra option for log space)
	- plots the expression levels for common genes
