\title{Gene variability}
\usage{
geneExpressionVariability(object, bins = 20, low = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{DigitalGeneExpressionMatrix} object.}

\item{bins}{The number of bins.}

\item{low}{Boolean. If True then the lowly varied genes are returned.}
}
\value{
A vector of the top \code{ntop} highly varied genes.
}
\description{
Compute the variability of each gene across all cells. The average expression
of each gene is first computed, sorted and the genes are placed into \code{b}
bins. The dispersion of genes into each bin is then z-normalized. A cuttoff
is then used to identify the top \code{h} highly variable genes. Genes with
mean expression should be removed before using this function. Computation
is performed in log space.
