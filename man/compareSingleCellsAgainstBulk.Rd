\title{Compare average gene expression from single cell data against bulk data.}
\usage{
compareSingleCellsAgainstBulk(single.cells, bulk.data, log.space = T,
  method = "pearson", ylab = "single cell sample", col = "steelblue", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{single.cells}{A \code{data.frame} containing genes as rownames and columns as cells.}

\item{bulk.data}{A \code{data.frame} containing genes as rownames and a single column
with transcript counts.}

\item{log.space}{If True (default value) then the average of single cells data is
performed in log space.}

\item{ylab}{Label of the single cell sample.}

\item{col}{The color of the scatterplot points.}
}
\value{
A scatterplot comparing the gene expression levels and with the correlation
among the samples computed.
